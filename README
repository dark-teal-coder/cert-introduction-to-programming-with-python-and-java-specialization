# Description 
This repository contains the code and data files for the online course *"SAS Programming 1 Essentials"* provided on [SAS Support](https://support.sas.com/edu/elearning.html). The course comes in the form of self-paced e-Learning courseware, which contains a series of lessons mainly divided into demostrations, activities and practices and a virtual learning environment called the [SAS Virtual Lab](https://labs.liveweb.sas.com/Citrix/SASLabsWeb/). The course files can be obtained from the SAS Virtual Lab within the same virtual learning environment or downloaded to use on [SAS OnDemand for Academics](https://www.sas.com/en_hk/software/on-demand-for-academics.html) or in your local SAS software, such as [SAS Enterprise Guide](https://support.sas.com/en/software/enterprise-guide-support.html). The course is designed to be completed in 21 hours. 

Since SAS Virtual Lab has an access limit of 180 days and the loading time can take up to a few minutes. Therefore, it is recommended that you use SAS OnDemand for Academics to access the course. Checkout the "setup" folder. Upload ```createdataPG1v2_oda.sas``` to SAS Studio on SAS OnDemand for Academics and run it to set up the practice files. Follow the instructions on [Setup Instructions for SAS OnDemand for Academics: SAS Studio](https://vle.sas.com/pluginfile.php/800779/mod_scorm/content/93/setup_soda_new.htm). After the setup is complete, you will see subfolders similar to the structure in ```EPG1V2.zip```. If something is missing, you may also find the data or program files in this .zip file.
